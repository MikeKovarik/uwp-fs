# uwp-fs

## Usage

Node's [`buffer`](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html) module is integral part of `fs` and thus `uwp-fs` and is `import`ed/`require`d as a dependency in the source code. You can use [`buffer`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/buffer) which is an exact port of Node's Buffer for use in browser, built on top of `Uint8Array`/`ArrayBuffer`. It is however not bundled with this module and has to be bundled and/or imported separately alongside this module.

Similarly the [`stream`](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html) module is needed to enable `fs.ReadStream`/`fs.WriteStream` classes and `fs.createWriteStream()`/`fs.createWriteStream()` APIs. This is however optional (and does not need to be bundled/imported) if you don't intend to use those classes and methods.

## Supported APIs

Work in progress.

Most of the groundwork is laid with emulated `open`, `read` and `close` syscalls. `fs.readFile` is starting to shape up.

## Caveats

Encodings are not part of `uwp-fs`. Those are implemented in `buffer` module and their usage therefore relies on the version of `buffer` used. Utf8 is used in the background for most of the data manipulation.

Please try to use most recent versions of `buffer` and `stream` modules. `uwp-fs` is built on top of latest APIs (and breaking changes) introduced in Node versions 6 (`Buffer.alloc()`, `Buffer.allocUnsafe()`) and Node 8 (`.destroy()` method on streams).

_None of the __*Sync__ (readFileSync, writeFileSync, etc...) APIs are available because UWP does not suppor synchronous file system operations._

APIs that involve symlinks (`fstat`, `lstat`, `stat`, ...) were not properly explored and tested yet. 

## Testing

Testing is done comparatively by running the same tests in both UWP and Node. Log from Node results is saved and UWP is then tested against it. `mouka` module is used to that. `mouka` uses similar API to `mocha` but allows storing test results and then importing and using them for comparison.
