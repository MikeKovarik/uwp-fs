# uwp-fs

📁 Node's `fs` module for Windows UWP apps. Wrapper of `Windows.Storage` APIs.

Windows 10 allows you to write native UWP (Windows store) apps with HTML and JavaScript but the `Windows.Storage` APIs for manipulating files is very difficult to use and the docs are confusing. To read a file you first have to get the right [`StorageFolder`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.storage.storagefolder) and/or [`StorageFile`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.storage.storagefile) objects, that you have to `storageFile.openAsync()` to get an instance of [`(I)RandomAccessStream`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.storage.streams.irandomaccessstream) that needs to be passed into [`DataReader`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.storage.streams.datareader) to then get an [`IBuffer`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.storage.streams.ibuffer) that can be finally converted to something sensible like `String` or `Uint8Array`. And that is only when you've been granted access to directory(ies) after asking user with `FilePicker`. But wait there's also `Windows.Storage.FileIO` namespace and whole lot more... Easy right?

The `Windows.Storage` APIs are hostile and even a simple file-reading can turn into tens of lines of code. That's why this project tries to wrap that into a nice and simple Node.js style `fs` API where you can read the file with just a `fs.readFile('path', (err, data) => console.log(data))` ;). Plus we've got Promises!

`uwp-fs` tries to be 1:1 drop in replacement for `fs`, with all the errors, like `ENOENT`, you've come to love :D

**Work in progress**, contributions welcomed.

## Installation & Usage

### Installation

```
npm install uwp-fs
```

The `uwp-fs` module is bundled into single file (UMD) that will be located in `./node_modules/uwp-fs/index.js`. **Don't forget to include it to your Visual Studio Project**.

Make sure you also include browser versions of `buffer` (and optionally `stream`). These do not come prebundled with `uwp-fs` but are necessary.


### Usage

Just drop in the `uwp-fs/index.js` script along node modules (see Dependencies for more)

``` js
<script src="./path/to/events.js"></script>
<script src="./path/to/buffer.js"></script>
<script src="./path/to/util.js"></script>
<script src="./path/to/stream.js"></script>
<script src="./uwp-fs/index.js"></script>
```

`uwp-fs` is bundled as an UMD module and as such it's exported at `window['uwp-fs']`.


``` js
var fs = window['uwp-fs']
```

### Dependencies

A few Node.js core modules are integral part of `fs`, and thus `uwp-fs`, and are `import`ed/`require`d as a dependency in the source code.

#### Required

* [`buffer`](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html). You can use [`buffer`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/buffer) which is an exact port of Node's Buffer for use in browser, built on top of `Uint8Array`/`ArrayBuffer`. It is however not bundled with this module and has to be bundled and/or imported separately alongside this module.
* [`util`](https://nodejs.org/api/util.html): Needed as a peer dependency for `buffer`

#### Optional

Following modules are optional and are not need to be bundled or imported along with `uwp-fs` if you don't intend to methods and classes that require them.

* [`stream`](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html) module is needed to enable `fs.ReadStream`/`fs.WriteStream` classes and `fs.createWriteStream()`/`fs.createWriteStream()` APIs.
* [`events`](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html)'s `EventEmitter` is needed for `fs.watch` (`FSWatcher`) and `fs.watchFile` (`StatWatcher`).

#### Note

`uwp-fs` comes prebundled as UMD module `index.js`. UMD format makes it get the `buffer` module from `window.buffer` (and its `Buffer` class is at `window.buffer.Buffer`), `stream` from `window.steam` (`window.stream.ReadableStream`, etc...)

Or you can give bundling it yourself a shot. Main file is at `uwp-fs/index.mjs`. It's written with ES Module `import` syntax and does not need to be tanspiled with babel unless you need to support older environments that do not support `async/await`.

### Example



## Supported APIs

Work in progress.

Most of the groundwork for reading is laid. `open`, `read` and `close` syscalls are emulated, enabling `fs.readFile`, `fs.readdir`. Streams and writing is on the way.

## Caveats

Windows UWP applications begin restricted and can only access `installedLocation` (read) and `localFolder` (read and write). To gain access to the whole filesystem, you have to first ask user to give you permissions to access `C:\` or sub/directory that is sufficient for your app. This is done by opening a FilePicker and letting user select folder (or the whole drive). This only has to be done once. `uwp-fs` then stores these folders for you in `AccessCache.StorageApplicationPermissions.futureAccessList` for future access.

Encodings are not part of `uwp-fs`. Those are implemented in `buffer` module and their usage therefore relies on the version of `buffer` used. Utf8 is used in the background for most of the data manipulation.

Please try to use most recent versions of `buffer` and `stream` modules. `uwp-fs` is built on top of latest APIs (and breaking changes) introduced in Node versions 6 (`Buffer.alloc()`, `Buffer.allocUnsafe()`) and Node 8 (`.destroy()` method on streams).

_None of the __*Sync__ (readFileSync, writeFileSync, etc...) APIs are available because UWP does not suppor synchronous file system operations._

APIs that involve symlinks (`fstat`, `lstat`, `stat`, ...) were not properly explored and tested yet. 

## Testing

Testing is done comparatively by running the same tests in both UWP and Node. Log from Node results is saved and UWP is then tested against it. `mouka` module is used to that. `mouka` uses similar API to `mocha` but allows storing test results and then importing and using them for comparison.

## Closing notes

`node_bundles_modules` folder contains couple of prebundled Node modules, that were not written by me, for a sake of the demo application and tests. Namely [`buffer`](https://github.com/feross/buffer) by ferros; Node's `stream`, `events`, `util` bundled with `rolup` and [`rollup-plugin-node-builtins`](https://github.com/calvinmetcalf/rollup-plugin-node-builtins). All credit for these modules goes to their respective authors.
